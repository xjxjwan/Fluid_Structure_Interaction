# Fluid-structure interaction using the Ghost Fluid Method
This project involves solving the two-dimensional compressible unsteady Euler equations, both as a stand-alone system, and interacting with a rigid body. Following successful completion of the project, the student will have a two-dimensional code capable of simulating flow around either a stationary or moving rigid body.
