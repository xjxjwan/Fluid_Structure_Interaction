# Fluid-structure interaction using the Ghost Fluid Method
This project involves solving the two-dimensional compressible unsteady Euler equations, both as a stand-alone system, and interacting with a rigid body. Following successful completion of the project, the student will have a two-dimensional code capable of simulating flow around either a stationary or moving rigid body.
Structure:
1. The .cpp and .h files in current folder are for 2D Riemann problem-based GFM, with visualize2D.py for simulation results visualization.
2. The '1D' foler contains the code for 1D Riemann problem-based GFM.
3. The '2D_SLIC' foler contains the code for 2D SLIC Euler Equation simulator.
4. In each folder, the 'res' folder contains simulation results, including simulation data, figures, and videos.
